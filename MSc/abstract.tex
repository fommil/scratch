The motion of stars S0-1, S0-2 and S0-4, in the vicinity of the galactic centre,
is investigated using a $\chi^2$ analysis of the parameters in our line of sight.
The resulting phase spaces for the black hole and fermion ball scenarios are compared.
We find that due to the lack of accurate $z$ or $v_z$ data, the upper limit of required observational
time to discriminate between the scenarios is of the order 30 to 40 years.
Such $z$ and $v_z$ data might allow us to eliminate one of the scenarios immediately.

The spectrum from the Sgr A* region is also investigated using a {\it simple} Newtonian, optically thick
and geometrically thin model for each
scenario. As has already been known for some time, this technique is not applicable to a possible
black hole scenario at Sgr A* and as a consequence, is incapable of explaining a cut-off in the
spectrum at around $10^{13}$Hz. This cut-off follows naturally from the fermion ball potential
distribution in this simple model. It should be noted that Advection Dominated Accretion Flow models (not
investigated here) are able to predict the observed spectrum for the black hole scenario.
