Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. R. D. Viollier, for this
interesting topic and the funding I needed to survive. Thanks go to Dr. G.
Tupper for help on the Newtonian derivations and to Prof. A. Ghez, Dr. F.
Baganoff and Dr. R. Coker for their communal spirit in the sharing of their
data. Physics needs more people with your attitude, in my opinion `read it from
the graph!' is a line spoken by frauds and ASCII is always welcome!

I must thank the UCT funding and housing departments for much amusement they
have given me in their amazing ability to be incompetent in every way possible.
My thanks for zero funding and an overpriced shanty.

Credit must be given to the GNU community, whom collectively have created an
operating system which has allowed me to run the simulations and produce in a
professional manner, this thesis and the figures therein. Thanks to Wayne Kerr
for many enlightening discussions on the numerics.

Thanks to the entire staff of the UCT physics department, you made me feel very
welcome! I would also like to thank the great friends I have made in the time I
have spent in this beautiful country. Hopefully we can all have a pint on my
turf next time!

I am very grateful to my parents, without their support this adventure would not
have been possible. Same goes for the big man upstairs, who is always looking
out for me.
