+\newsection{Traces\label{Integrals}}
+
+The final ingredient required to construct noncommutative field theory
+action functionals is a definition of integration. At the algebraic
+level, we define an integral to be a
+trace on the algebra $\overline{U(\mfn)^\complex}$, i.e. a map
+$\ncint:\overline{U(\mfn)^\complex}\to\complex$ which is linear,
+\beq
+\ncint\bigl(c_1\,\Omega(f)+c_2\,\Omega(g)\bigr)=
+c_1\,\ncint\Omega(f)+c_2\,\ncint\Omega(g)
+\label{ncintlin}\eeq
+for all $f,g\in\CC^\infty(\mfn^*)$ and $c_1,c_2\in\complex$, and which
+is cyclic,
+\beq
+\ncint\Omega(f)\cdot\Omega(g)=\ncint\Omega(g)\cdot\Omega(f) \ .
+\label{ncintcyclic}\eeq
+We define the integral in the star-product formalism using the usual
+definitions for the integration of commuting Schwartz functions in
+$\CC^\infty(\R^6)$. Then the linearity property (\ref{ncintlin}) is
+automatically satisfied. To satisfy the cyclicity requirement
+(\ref{ncintcyclic}), we
+introduce~\cite{CalWohl1,BehrSyk1,AA-CAA1,DJMTWW1,FelShoi1} a measure
+$\kappa$ on $\R^6$ which deforms the flat space volume element
+$\dd\mbf x$ and define
+\beq
+\ncint\Omega(f):=\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~f(\mbf x) \ .
+\label{ncintdef}\eeq
+The measure $\kappa$ is chosen in order to achieve the property
+(\ref{ncintcyclic}), so that
+\beq
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~(f\star g)(\mbf x)=
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~(g\star f)(\mbf x) \ .
+\label{mucyclic}\eeq
+Such a measure always exists~\cite{CalWohl1,DJMTWW1,FelShoi1} and its
+inclusion in the present context is natural for the curved spacetime
+$\NW_6$ which we are considering here. It is important note that, for
+the star-products that we use, a measure which satisfies
+(\ref{mucyclic}) gives the integral the additional property
+\beq
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~(f\star g)(\mbf x)=
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~f(\mbf x)\,g(\mbf x) \ ,
+\label{ncintaddprop}\eeq
+providing an explicit realization of the Connes-Flato-Sternheimer
+conjecture~\cite{FelShoi1}.
+
+Since the coordinate functions $x_a$ generate the
+noncommutative algebra, the cyclicity constraint (\ref{mucyclic}) is
+equivalent to the star-commutator condition
+\beq
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~\bigl[(x_a)^n\,,\,f(\mbf x)
+\bigr]_\star=0
+\label{starcommcond}\eeq
+which must hold for arbitrary functions $f\in\CC^\infty(\R^6)$ (for
+which the integral makes sense) and for
+all $n\in\N$, $a=1,\dots,6$. Expanding the star-commutator bracket
+using its derivation property brings (\ref{starcommcond}) to the form
+\beq
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~\sum_{m=0}^n\,{n\choose
+  m}\,(x_a)^{n-m}\star\bigl[x_a\,,\,f(\mbf x)\bigr]_\star\star
+(x_a)^m=0 \ .
+\label{commcondexp}\eeq
+We may thus insert the explicit form of $[x_a,f]_\star$ for generic
+$f$ and use the ordinary integration by parts property
+\beq
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~f(\mbf x)\,g(\mbf x)\,(\partial^a)^nh(\mbf x)=
+(-1)^n\,\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\bigl(f(\mbf x)\,(\partial^a)^n
+g(\mbf x)\,
+h(\mbf x)+(\partial^a)^nf(\mbf x)\,g(\mbf x)\,h(\mbf x)\bigr)
+\label{intpartsfgh}\eeq
+for Schwartz functions $f,g,h\in\CC^\infty(\R^6)$. This will lead to a
+number of constraints on the measure~$\kappa$.
+
+The trace (\ref{ncintdef}) can also be used to define an inner product
+$(-,-):\CC^\infty(\mfn^*)\times\CC^\infty(\mfn^*)\to\complex$
+through
+\beq
+(f,g):=\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~\bigl(\,\overline{f}\star
+g\bigr)(\mbf x) \ .
+\label{ncintinnprod}\eeq
+Note that this is different from the inner product introduced in
+Section~\ref{Defs}. When we come to deal with the variational
+principle in the next section, we shall require that our
+star-derivative operators $\partial^a_\star$ be anti-hermitean with
+respect to the inner product (\ref{ncintinnprod}),
+i.e. $(f,\partial^a_\star\triangleright
+g)=-(\partial^a_\star\triangleright f,g)$, or equivalently
+\beq
+\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~\bigl(\,\overline{f}\star
+\partial_\star^a
+\triangleright g\bigr)(\mbf x)=-\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~
+\bigl(\,\overline{\partial_\star^a\triangleright f}\star g\bigr)(\mbf x) \ .
+\label{ncintparts}\eeq
+This allows for a generalized integration by parts
+property~\cite{DJMTWW1} for our noncommutative integral. As always, we
+will now go through our list of star-products to explore the
+properties of the integral in each case. We will find that the measure
+$\kappa$ is not uniquely determined by the above criteria and there is
+a large flexibility in the choices that can be made. We will also find
+that the derivatives of the previous section must be generically
+modified by a $\kappa$-dependent shift in order to
+satisfy~(\ref{ncintparts}).
+
+\subsection{Time Ordering\label{TOint}}
+
+Using (\ref{TOxfprods}) along with the analogous $*$-products $f*x_a$
+we arrive at the $*$-commutators
+\begin{eqnarray}
+ \cb{x^-}{f}_\ast&=&\ii\theta\,\left(\,\obfz\cdot\obfd
+    -\bfz\cdot\bfd\right)f \ , \nn \\ \nn
+  \cb{x^+}{f}_\ast&=&0 \ , \\ \nn
+  \cb{z_i}{f}_\ast&=&z_i\,\left(1
+    -\e^{-\ii\theta\,\d_-}\right)f-\ii\theta\,x^+\,\left(1
+    +\e^{-\ii\theta\,\d_-}\right)\od{}^{\,i}f \ , \\
+  \cb{\,\oz_i}{f}_\ast&=&\oz_i\,\left(1
+    -\e^{\ii\theta\,\d_-}\right)f+\ii\theta\,x^+\,\left(1
+    +\e^{\ii\theta\,\d_-}\right)\d^if \ .
+\label{eq:time:comm}\end{eqnarray}
+When inserted into \eqref{commcondexp}, after integration by parts and
+application of the derivative rule (\ref{derivrule1})
+these expressions imply constraints on the corresponding measure
+$\kappa_\ast$ given by
+\begin{eqnarray}
+\left(1-\e^{\ii\theta\,\d_-}\right)\kappa_\ast&=&0 \ , \nn \\
+\left(1+\e^{\ii\theta\,\d_-}\right)\od{}^{\,i}\kappa_\ast&=&0 \ , \nn \\ \nn
+\left(1-\e^{-\ii\theta\,\d_-}\right)\d^i\kappa_\ast&=&0 \ , \\
+  \bfz\cdot\bfd\kappa_\ast&=&\obfz\cdot\obfd\kappa_\ast \ .
+ \label{eq:time:mu:all}\end{eqnarray}
+It is straightforward to see that the equations (\ref{eq:time:mu:all})
+imply that the measure must be independent of both the light-cone
+position and transverse coordinates, so that
+\begin{equation}
+  \label{eq:time:mu}
+  \partial_-\kappa_\ast=\d^i\kappa_\ast=\od{}^{\,i}\kappa_\ast=0 \ .
+\end{equation}
+
+However, the derivative $\d_+^\ast$ in \eqref{TOderivs} does not
+satisfy the anti-hermiticity requirement \eqref{ncintparts}. This can be
+remedied by translating it by a logarithmic derivative of the measure
+$\kappa_*$ and defining the modified $*$-derivative
+\beq
+  \label{eq:time:d}
+ \widetilde\d{}^{\,\ast}_+=\d_+ + \mbox{$\frac12$}\,\d_+\ln\kappa_\ast \ .
+\eeq
+The remaining $*$-derivatives in (\ref{TOderivs}) are unaltered. While
+this redefinition has no adverse effects on the commutation relations
+\eqref{eq:rho:nw4}, the action
+$\widetilde\d{}^{\,\ast}_+\triangleright f$ contains an additional
+linear term in $f$ even if the function $f$ is independent of the time
+coordinate $x^+$.
+
+\subsection{Symmetric Time Ordering\label{STOint}}
+
+Using \eqref{STOxfprods} along with the corresponding
+$\bullet$-products $f\bullet x_a$ we arrive at the
+$\bullet$-commutators
+\begin{eqnarray}
+\nn  \cb{x^-}{f}_\bullet&=&\ii\theta\,\left(\,
+\obfz\cdot\obfd -\bfz\cdot\bfd\right)f \ , \\ \nn
+  \cb{x^+}{f}_\bullet&=&0 \ , \\ \nn
+  \cb{z_i}{f}_\bullet&=&2\ii
+  z_i\,\sin\left(\mbox{$\frac\theta2$}\,\partial_-
+\right)f-2\ii\theta\,x^+\,\od{}^{\,i}
+\cos\left(\mbox{$\frac\theta2$}\,\partial_-\right)f \ , \\
+  \cb{\,\oz_i}{f}_\bullet&=&-2\ii\oz_i\,\sin\left(\mbox{$\frac\theta2$}
+\,\partial_-\right)f+2\ii\theta\,x^+\d^i\cos
+\left(\mbox{$\frac\theta2$}\,\partial_-\right)f \ .
+  \label{eq:symtime:comm}\end{eqnarray}
+Substituting these into \eqref{commcondexp} and integrating by parts,
+we arrive at constraints on the measure $\kappa_\bullet$ given by
+\begin{eqnarray}
+ \nn  \bigl(1-\od{}^{\,i}\bigr)\sin\left(\mbox{$\frac\theta2$}\,
+\partial_-\right)\kappa_\bullet&=&0 \ , \\ \nn
+  \bigl(1+\d^i\bigr)\sin\left(\mbox{$\frac\theta2$}\,
+\partial_-\right)\kappa_\bullet&=&0 \ , \\
+  \bfz\cdot\bfd\kappa_\bullet&=&\obfz\cdot\obfd\kappa_\bullet
+ \label{eq:symtime:mu:all}\end{eqnarray}
+which can be reduced to the conditions
+\begin{equation}
+  \label{eq:symtime:mu:rest}
+  \bfz\cdot\bfd\kappa_\bullet=\obfz\cdot\obfd\kappa_\bullet \ ,
+  \quad \d_-\kappa_\bullet=0 \ .
+\end{equation}
+Now the derivative operators $\d_+^\bullet$, $\d^i_\bullet$ and
+$\od{}^{\,i}_\bullet$ all violate the requirement
+\eqref{ncintparts}. Introducing translates of $\d^i_\bullet$ and
+$\od{}^{\,i}_\bullet$ analogously to what we did in (\ref{eq:time:d})
+is problematic. While such a shift does not alter the canonical
+commutation relations between the coordinates and derivatives,
+i.e. the algebraic properties of the differential operators, it does
+violate the $\bullet$-commutator relationships \eqref{dxreq} and
+\eqref{eq:rho:nw4} for generic functions $f$. Consistency between
+differential operator and function commutators would only be
+possible in this case by demanding that multiplication from the left
+follow a Leibniz-like rule for the translated part.
+
+Thus in order to satisfy both sets of constraints, we are forced to
+further require that the measure $\kappa_\bullet$ depend only on the
+plane wave time coordinate $x^+$ so that (\ref{eq:symtime:mu:rest})
+truncates to
+\begin{equation}
+  \label{eq:symtime:mu}
+  \d^i\kappa_\bullet=\od{}^{\,i}\kappa_\bullet=\d_-\kappa_\bullet=0 \ .
+\end{equation}
+The logarithmic translation of $\d_+^\bullet$ must still be applied in
+order to ensure that the time derivative is anti-hermitean with
+respect to the noncommutative inner product. This modifies its action
+to
+\beq
+  \label{eq:symtime:d}
+  \widetilde\d{}^{\,\bullet}_+=\d_++\mbox{$\frac12$}\,\d_+\ln\kappa_\bullet
+\ .
+\eeq
+ The actions of all other $\bullet$-derivatives are as in
+ \eqref{STOderivs}. Again this shifting has no adverse effects on
+ \eqref{eq:rho:nw4}, but it carries the same warning as in the time
+ ordered case regarding extra linear terms from the action
+ $\widetilde\d{}^{\,\bullet}_+\triangleright f$.
+
+\subsection{Weyl Ordering\label{Weylint}}
+
+Finally, the Weyl ordered star-products \eqref{Weylxfprods} along with
+the corresponding $f\star x_a$ products lead to the
+$\star$-commutators
+\begin{eqnarray}
+  \nn \cb{x^-}{f}_\star&=&\ii\theta\,\left(\,\obfz\cdot\obfd
+    -\bfz\cdot\bfd\right)f \ , \\ \nn
+  \cb{x^+}{f}_\star&=&0 \ , \\ \nn
+   \cb{z_i}{f}_\star&=&\ii\theta\,\left(z_i\,\d_-
+    -2x^+\,\od{}^{\,i}\right)f \ , \\
+  \cb{\,\oz_i}{f}_\star&=&\ii\theta\,\left(-\oz_i\,\d_-
+    +2x^+\,\d^i\right)f \ .
+\label{eq:weyl:comm}\end{eqnarray}
+Substituting these commutation relations into \eqref{commcondexp},
+integrating by parts, and using the derivative rules
+(\ref{derivrule1}) and (\ref{derivrule2}) leads to the corresponding
+measure constraints
+\begin{eqnarray}
+   \nn  z_i\,\d_-\kappa_\star&=&2x^+\,\od{}^{\,i}\kappa_\star \ , \\ \nn
+  \oz_i\,\d_-\kappa_\star&=&2x^+\,\d^i\kappa_\star \ , \\
+  \bfz\cdot\bfd\kappa_\star&=&\obfz\cdot\obfd\kappa_\star \ .
+\label{eq:weyl:mu:all}\end{eqnarray}
+Again these differential equations imply that the measure
+$\kappa_\star$ depends only on the plane wave time coordinate $x^+$ so
+that
+\begin{equation}
+  \label{eq:weyl:mu}
+  \d_-\kappa_\star=\d^i\kappa_\star=\od{}^{\,i}\kappa_\star=0 \ .
+\end{equation}
+Translating the derivative operator $\d_+^\star$ as before in order to
+satisfy \eqref{ncintparts} yields the modified derivative
+\beq
+  \label{eq:weyl:d}
+  \widetilde\d{}^{\,\star}_+=\d_++2\,
+\left(1-\frac{\sin(\theta\,\partial_-)}{\theta\,\partial_-}
+\right)\,\frac{\overline{\mdell}\cdot\mdell}{\partial_-}+
+\mbox{$\frac12$}\,\d_+\ln\kappa_\star \ ,
+\eeq
+with the remaining $\star$-derivatives in \eqref{Weylderivs}
+unchanged. Once again this produces no major alteration to
+\eqref{eq:rho:nw4} but does yield extra linear terms in the actions
+$\widetilde\d{}^{\,\star}_+\triangleright f$.

 Given a real scalar field $\varphi\in\CC^\infty(\mfn^*)$ of mass $m$,
 we define an action functional using the integral (\ref{ncintdef}) by
-\begin{equation}
+\beq
 S[\varphi]=\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~\left[
 \mbox{$\frac12$}\,\eta_{ab}\,\bigl(\,\widetilde
 {\partial}{}^{\,a}_{\star}\triangleright\varphi\bigr)\star
 \bigl(\,\widetilde{\partial}{}^{\,b}_{\star}\triangleright\varphi\bigr)+
 \mbox{$\frac12$}\,m^2\,\varphi\star\varphi\right] \ ,
-\label{Svarphidef}\end{equation}
-where $\eta_{ab}$ is the invariant metric tensor induced by the inner
-product (\ref{NW4innerprod}) with the non-vanishing components
+\label{Svarphidef}\eeq
+where $\eta_{ab}$ is the invariant Minkowski metric tensor induced by
+the inner product (\ref{NW4innerprod}) with the non-vanishing components
 $\eta_{\pm\,\mp}=1$ and $\eta_{z_i\,\overline{z}_j}=\frac12\,\delta_{ij}$. The
 tildes on the derivatives in (\ref{Svarphidef}) indicate that the time
 component must be appropriately shifted as described in the previous
 section. Using the property (\ref{ncintaddprop}) we may simplify the
 action to the form
-\begin{equation}
+\beq
 S[\varphi]=\int\limits_{\R^6}\,\dd\mbf x~\kappa(\mbf x)~\left[
 \mbox{$\frac12$}\,\eta_{ab}\,\bigl(\,\widetilde

 \mbox{$\frac12$}\,m^2\,\varphi^2\right] \ .
-\label{Svarphisimpl}\end{equation}
+\label{Svarphisimpl}\eeq
 
 By using the integration by parts property (\ref{ncintparts}) on
 Schwartz fields $\varphi$, we may easily compute the first order
 variation of the action (\ref{Svarphisimpl}) to be

+\beq
 \frac{\delta S[\varphi]}{\delta\varphi}~\delta\varphi:=

-\label{actionvary1}\end{equation}
+\label{actionvary1}\eeq
 Applying the variational principle $\frac{\delta
   S[\varphi]}{\delta\varphi}=0$ to (\ref{actionvary1}) thereby leads
 to the noncommutative Klein-Gordan field equation
-\begin{equation}
+\beq
 \Box^\star\triangleright\varphi-m^2\,\varphi=0

 $\star$-differential operator $\Box^\star$ should be regarded as a deformation

 In the case of time ordering, we use (\ref{TOderivs}) to compute

 particle on flat Minkowski space $\eucl^{1,5}$ (Deviations from

+flat spacetime can only come about here by choosing a time-dependent measure
 $\kappa_*$). This illustrates the point made above that the treatment
 of the present paper tackles only the semi-classical flat space limit of the
 spacetime $\NW_6$. The appropriate curved geometry for this ordering
 corresponds to the global coordinate system (\ref{NW4metricNW}) in
 which the classical Laplace operator is given by
-\begin{equation}
-\Box_0^*=2\,\partial_+\,\partial_-+\overline{\mdell}\cdot\mdell+

 so that the free wave equation $(\Box_0^*-m^2)\varphi=0$ is equivalent
 to the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle of charge $p^+$ (the
 momentum along the $x^-$ direction) in a constant magnetic field
 of strength~$\theta$. A global pseudo-orthonormal frame is provided by

 Determining the derivations $\delta_*^a$ corresponding to the
 commuting frame (\ref{TOorthoframe}) on the quantum space is in
 general rather difficult. Evidently, from the coproduct structure
