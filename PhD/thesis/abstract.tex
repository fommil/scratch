  We characterise the worldvolume theories on symmetric and non-symmetric
  D-branes in the six-dimensional Nappi-Witten spacetime. We find classes of
  Euclidean and Lorentzian noncommutative D3-branes, the physical origins of
  which are described through the interplay between isometric embeddings of
  branes in the spacetime and the Penrose-G\"uven limit of $\AdS_3\times\S^3$. A
  non-symmetric spacetime-filling D-brane is constructed to give a spatially
  varying noncommutativity, analogous to that of the Dolan-Nappi model.

  We then describe an algebraic approach to the time-dependent noncommutative
  geometry of the Nappi-Witten spacetime and develop a formalism to construct
  and analyse field theories defined thereon. Various $\star$-products are
  derived in closed explicit form and the Hopf algebra of twisted isometries is
  constructed. Scalar field theories are defined using explicit forms of
  derivative operators, traces and noncommutative frame fields. Noncommutative
  worldvolume field theories of the aforementioned D-branes are also
  constructed.

  All techniques throughout are presented in such a manner that they may be
  applied to generic homogeneous pp-waves supported by a constant Neveu-Schwarz
  flux.
